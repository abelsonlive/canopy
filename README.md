#Canopy

##TODO
- geolocation utility
- color legend for species 
- histogram for species distribution by neighborhood, guidelines for achieving benchmarks
- Filter by viewable area
- Filter by radius from geolocation
- Overlay for areas in need of trees, areas ready for planting, intersection
- Time series view
- Removal intensities
- request tool with reporting
- more info about trees (origin etc.)
- cultivar level info


## Species Characteristics to be explored
- hardiness
- spring blooms
- fall color
- mature size
- growth rate
- growth habit

## Priority Areas
- increasing human population
- decreasing tree population
- high imperviousness

## Site Factors
- higher sidewalk width
- less overhead lines
- more long green strips
- more existing trees (as indicator of health)
